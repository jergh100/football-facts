  <h1>Most Goals in a Premier League Season</h1>
  <p>The current record for most goals scored in a single Premier League season is held by <strong>Erling Haaland</strong>, who netted <strong>36 goals</strong> in the 2022/23 season for Manchester City.</p>
  <p>Haaland broke the long-standing joint record of <strong>34 goals</strong> set by <strong>Andy Cole</strong> (1993/94) and <strong>Alan Shearer</strong> (1994/95) — both of whom scored their tallies when the league had 42 games instead of 38.</p>
  <p><em>Fun Fact:</em> Haaland achieved his record without taking penalties for a large part of the season, making his goal-per-minute ratio even more impressive.</p>
