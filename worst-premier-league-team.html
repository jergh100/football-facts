  <h1>Worst Premier League Team</h1>
  <p>The unfortunate title of the worst Premier League team goes to <strong>Derby County</strong>, who had a historically poor season in <strong>2007/08</strong>.</p>
  <p>They finished with just <strong>11 points</strong> from 38 games — a record low. Derby won only one match and ended the season with a goal difference of <strong>-69</strong>.</p>
  <p><em>Did you know?</em> Their only win came against Newcastle United, and they conceded a whopping <strong>89 goals</strong>.</p>
