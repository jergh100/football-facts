  <h1>What Is a Brace in Football?</h1>
  <p>A <strong>brace</strong> in football refers to a player scoring <strong>two goals</strong> in a single match.</p>
  <p>The term comes from old English hunting language where “a brace” meant two of the same — like a brace of pheasants.</p>
  <p>So when a player scores twice, commentators and fans often say they “scored a brace.”</p>
