  <h1>Who Invented Football?</h1>
  <p>The origins of football trace back thousands of years, but the <strong>modern game</strong> as we know it today was invented in <strong>England</strong> in the mid-19th century.</p>
  <p>In <strong>1863</strong>, the Football Association (FA) was formed in London. It was here that the first standardized set of rules was created — marking the official birth of association football (soccer).</p>
  <p>Earlier forms of the game existed in ancient China (called <em>cuju</em>), Greece, Rome, and among native South American cultures. However, the FA’s rulebook is what truly defined football globally.</p>
  <p><em>Fun Fact:</em> Rugby and football were once the same sport — they split after a disagreement over whether handling the ball was allowed!</p>
