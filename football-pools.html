  <h1>Football Pools: Do They Still Exist?</h1>
  <p>Football pools were once the go-to weekend gamble for millions of Brits. But are they still around — and can you still play them today?</p>

  <h2>What Are Football Pools?</h2>
  <p>Football pools are a type of game where players predict the outcomes of football matches — typically focusing on score draws (1–1, 2–2, etc.). Points are awarded for correct predictions, and prizes go to those with the highest scores.</p>

  <h2>A Bit of History</h2>
  <p>The football pools date back to <strong>1923</strong> with companies like <strong>Littlewoods</strong> and <strong>Vernons</strong>. By the 1980s, over 10 million people were playing each week in the UK.</p>

  <h2>Do Football Pools Still Exist?</h2>
  <p>Yes — although they're no longer a Saturday ritual for the masses, you can still play today at sites like <a href="https://www.thepools.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ThePools.com</a>, which is the modern version of the traditional game.</p>

  <h2>How to Play in 2024</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Register at a football pools site like ThePools</li>
    <li>Pick 10+ games where you think both teams will draw</li>
    <li>Points are awarded for correct picks</li>
    <li>Top scorers win cash prizes, depending on the game and number of entries</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Pools vs Modern Betting</h2>
  <p>Unlike fixed-odds betting, the football pools rely on <strong>shared prize pots</strong> and traditional scoring systems. They’re more strategic and less dependent on odds.</p>

  <h2>Where to Play</h2>
  <p>The most active and official provider is <a href="https://www.thepools.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ThePools.com</a>. It's licensed, secure, and offers several pools-based games every week.</p>
