  <h1>Why Do Players Get Yellow Cards in Football?</h1>
  <p>A <strong>yellow card</strong> is a caution given by the referee for misconduct or unsporting behavior during a match.</p>
  <p>Common reasons for receiving a yellow card include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Unsporting behavior (diving, reckless tackles)</li>
    <li>Dissent by word or action</li>
    <li>Delaying the restart of play</li>
    <li>Failing to respect the required distance on free kicks or corners</li>
    <li>Entering or leaving the field without permission</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Two yellow cards</em> in a match lead to a red card and automatic ejection from the game.</p>
  <p><em>Fun Fact:</em> Yellow and red cards were introduced at the 1970 FIFA World Cup to provide a universal visual signal across languages.</p>
