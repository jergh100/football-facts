  <h1>What is a Hat-Trick in Football?</h1>
  <p>A <strong>hat-trick</strong> occurs when a player scores <strong>three goals in a single match</strong>. It's a celebrated feat and often earns the player the match ball as a memento.</p>
  <p>A <strong>perfect hat-trick</strong> is even rarer — it includes one goal scored with the right foot, one with the left foot, and one with the head, all in the same game.</p>
  <p><em>Fun Fact:</em> The term 'hat-trick' originated in cricket in the 1800s, when a player who took three wickets in a row was given a hat as a reward. It was later adopted into football culture.</p>
