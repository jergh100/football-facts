  <h1>Biggest Football Stadium in the World</h1>
  <p>The <strong>Rungrado 1st of May Stadium</strong>, located in Pyongyang, North Korea, is officially the biggest football stadium in the world by capacity.</p>
  <p>It can reportedly hold up to <strong>114,000 spectators</strong>, although exact figures are debated due to limited access and verification.</p>
  <p><strong>Other large stadiums include:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>🏟️ Camp Nou (Barcelona, Spain) – ~99,000</li>
    <li>🏟️ Melbourne Cricket Ground (used for football in Australia) – ~100,000</li>
    <li>🏟️ Wembley Stadium (London, England) – ~90,000</li>
    <li>🏟️ Salt Lake Stadium (India) – ~85,000</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Fun Fact:</em> Despite its massive size, the Rungrado Stadium is rarely full. Some of the world’s most passionate football atmospheres come from smaller venues!</p>
