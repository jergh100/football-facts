  <h1>How Long Is a Football Match?</h1>
  <p>A standard football match is played over <strong>90 minutes</strong>, split into two halves of 45 minutes each. There's a <strong>15-minute halftime break</strong> between the two halves.</p>
  <p>Additional <strong>stoppage time</strong> (also known as injury time) is added at the end of each half to account for any delays, substitutions, or time-wasting during play.</p>
  <p>If the match is part of a knockout competition, it can also include <strong>30 minutes of extra time</strong> (two 15-minute halves) and, if still tied, a <strong>penalty shootout</strong> to determine the winner.</p>
  <p><em>Did you know?</em> The longest official football match lasted over <strong>3 hours</strong>, due to multiple extra time periods and shootout delays.</p>
