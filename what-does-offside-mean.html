  <h1>What Does Offside Mean in Football?</h1>
  <p>The <strong>offside rule</strong> is designed to prevent attackers from gaining an unfair advantage by hanging close to the opponent’s goal.</p>
  <p>A player is in an offside position if:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>They are nearer to the opponent’s goal line than both the ball and the second-last defender</li>
    <li>They are involved in active play (receiving a pass or interfering with play)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A player is <strong>not offside</strong> if they are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In their own half of the pitch</li>
    <li>Level with the second-last defender</li>
    <li>Receiving the ball from a goal kick, corner, or throw-in</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Fun Fact:</em> The offside rule has existed in some form since the 1800s — but it still sparks debate every week!</p>
