  <h1>What Do Goalkeepers Wear?</h1>
  <p>Football goalkeepers wear specialized equipment designed to enhance performance and provide protection. Their gear includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Goalkeeper Gloves:</strong> Essential for grip and shock absorption when catching or parrying the ball.</li>
    <li><strong>Padded Jersey:</strong> Often includes elbow or shoulder padding to reduce impact from dives.</li>
    <li><strong>Goalkeeper Shorts or Trousers:</strong> Some wear padded shorts, while others prefer long padded trousers for sliding.</li>
    <li><strong>Football Boots:</strong> Typically firm ground or soft ground, depending on pitch type — just like outfield players.</li>
    <li><strong>Optional Gear:</strong> Knee pads, finger saves, compression wear, or headgear for added protection.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Fun Fact:</em> Goalkeepers must wear a kit that is clearly distinguishable from both teams and the referee — that's why their jerseys are often bright or unusual colors.</p>
