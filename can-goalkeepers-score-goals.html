  <h1>Can Goalkeepers Score Goals?</h1>
  <p>Yes ‚Äî goalkeepers can score goals in football, and some have made it a surprising part of their legacy.</p>

  <h2>‚öΩ How Do Goalkeepers Score?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Penalties & Free Kicks:</strong> Some keepers take set-pieces (e.g. Rog√©rio Ceni, Jos√© Luis Chilavert)</li>
    <li><strong>Headers from Corners:</strong> Often during last-minute attacks when the keeper joins the play</li>
    <li><strong>Long Kicks or Clearances:</strong> Sometimes the ball bounces over the opposing goalkeeper</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üß§ Notable Goal-Scoring Goalkeepers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Rog√©rio Ceni</strong> ‚Äì 131 career goals (mostly free kicks and penalties)</li>
    <li><strong>Jos√© Luis Chilavert</strong> ‚Äì 67 goals, including a hat-trick!</li>
    <li><strong>Alisson Becker</strong> ‚Äì Scored a last-minute header for Liverpool in 2021</li>
