  <h1>Why Do Footballers Tape Their Socks?</h1>
  <p>Ever noticed footballers with tape around their socks? It's more than just a style choice ‚Äî there are practical reasons behind it.</p>

  <h2>‚öΩ Reasons Players Use Tape</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Hold shin pads in place:</strong> Tape keeps them from sliding during play</li>
    <li><strong>Support:</strong> Tape around the ankle offers slight stability and compression</li>
    <li><strong>Split socks setup:</strong> Many pros wear grip socks and cut their official socks ‚Äî tape joins them together</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üõë Rules to Know</h2>
  <p>According to FIFA kit regulations, any visible tape must match the colour of the sock it covers ‚Äî usually enforced at professional levels.</p>

  <p><em>Fun Fact:</em> Taping became more common after players started cutting their team socks to wear their own branded grip socks underneath.</p>
