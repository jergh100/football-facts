  <h1>What Is a Clean Sheet in Football?</h1>
  <p>A <strong>clean sheet</strong> means a team has finished a match without conceding any goals.</p>
  <p>It’s often used to measure the performance of a team’s defense and especially the goalkeeper.</p>
  <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>A 0–0 draw = clean sheet for both sides</li>
    <li>A 2–0 win = clean sheet for the winning team</li>
    <li>A 3–1 win = no clean sheet</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Fun Fact:</em> Goalkeepers are awarded “clean sheets” in official stats, and many aim to lead the league in clean sheets each season.</p>
