  <h1>What is Stoppage Time in Football?</h1>
  <p><strong>Stoppage time</strong> (also called injury time) is the additional time added to the end of each half of a football match to make up for time lost due to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Injuries</li>
    <li>Substitutions</li>
    <li>Goal celebrations</li>
    <li>Time-wasting or VAR reviews</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The <strong>referee decides</strong> how much time to add based on input from the fourth official. It’s usually between 1 and 10 minutes depending on the events in the half.</p>
  <p><em>Fun Fact:</em> The longest recorded stoppage time in a professional match was over 28 minutes due to a major injury and extended VAR delays.</p>
