  <h1>Most Expensive Football Transfer</h1>
  <p>The most expensive football transfer in history is <strong>Neymar's move</strong> from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in <strong>2017</strong>.</p>
  <p>PSG activated his release clause, paying a record-breaking fee of <strong>€222 million</strong> (around £200 million or $263 million at the time).</p>
  <p>This move redefined the transfer market, setting a new bar for player valuations and financial muscle in football.</p>
  <p><em>Fun Fact:</em> Neymar’s fee is still unmatched, even years later — although players like Kylian Mbappé and Jude Bellingham have come close!</p>
