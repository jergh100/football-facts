  <h1>Most Red Cards in Football History</h1>
  <p>Red cards are rare ‚Äî but some players made them part of their legacy. Here's who leads the way:</p>
  <h3>üü• Most red cards by a player:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Gerardo Bedoya</strong> (Colombia) ‚Äì 46 red cards</li>
    <li><strong>Sergio Ramos</strong> (Spain) ‚Äì 28 red cards (most in Europe‚Äôs top leagues)</li>
    <li><strong>Cyril Rool</strong> (France) ‚Äì 27 red cards</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>‚öΩ Most red cards by a team (Premier League):</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Everton</strong> ‚Äì 106 red cards (as of 2024)</li>
    <li><strong>Arsenal</strong> ‚Äì Over 100 red cards in Premier League history</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Fun Fact:</em> Bedoya once received a red card for elbowing an opponent, kicking him while he was down, and then insulting the referee ‚Äî all in one incident.</p>
