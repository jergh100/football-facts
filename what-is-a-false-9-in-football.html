  <h1>What Is a False 9 in Football?</h1>
  <p>A <strong>false 9</strong> is a type of striker who drops deeper into midfield instead of staying up front like a traditional centre-forward.</p>

  <h2>🎯 How It Works</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Pulls defenders out of position to create space behind</li>
    <li>Links midfield and attack by creating overloads centrally</li>
    <li>Relies on teammates (often wingers or attacking midfielders) to make runs behind</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🔝 Famous False 9 Players</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Lionel Messi</strong> – The classic false 9 during Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona era</li>
    <li><strong>Francesco Totti</strong> – Used the role at Roma long before it was a trend</li>
    <li><strong>Roberto Firmino</strong> – Modern example who drops deep to link play for Liverpool</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>Fun Fact:</em> The term "false 9" became widely used after Guardiola’s Barcelona used Messi in that role against Real Madrid in 2009 — and won 6–2.</p>
