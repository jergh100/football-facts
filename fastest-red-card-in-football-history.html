  <h1>Fastest Red Card in Football History</h1>
  <p>The fastest red card ever shown in professional football occurred just <strong>2 seconds</strong> into the match.</p>
  <p><strong>Lee Todd</strong> received the red in 2000 while playing for Cross Farm Park Celtic. As soon as the referee blew the whistle to start the game, Todd responded, “F*** me, that was loud,” and was immediately sent off for foul language.</p>
  <p><em>In terms of gameplay:</em> Some players have received red cards within 10–15 seconds of making their first challenge — including tackle-based reds for reckless fouls straight from kick-off.</p>
